# Is it rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane?


I picked the question above because it was interesting to me and my experiences. I just got back from a very long flight and I was considering moving seats because my T.V. wasn't working. However, before I could ask the flight attendent to move somone else moved into the other open seat. So because I just had this experience I was interested in this question 

The data revels that out of the sample most people think that is is "not rude at all" to movei into an open seat.
